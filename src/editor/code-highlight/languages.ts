 * Language grammars for fenced code.

 * bundle fully tree-shakeable and analysable, and avoids per-language dynamic chunks for
 * something that is already a rounding error next to ProseMirror.
 *
 * If a language really is missing, `refractor/all` or a per-language
 * `import('refractor/haskell')` can be registered here later; the resolver below already
 * treats "unknown" as a normal outcome.
